<p>This is a script for zsh installation in some Linux distros. I have tested this script in Arch Linux, Fedora and ZorinOs (Debian/Ubuntu based). But I believe it will work on other distros like OpenSuse</p>

### Why this script?
<p>Sometimes I install a full fresh Os in my PC. So installing and configuring zsh is much painful for me. Thats why I have write this script so that I can install and configure zsh and oh-my-zsh easily.</p>

### In which distros will this script work?
<p>I believe it will work on some distros. Like,</p>

- #### Arch Linux and Arch based distros
- #### Debian and Ubuntu and all the distros that uses the `apt` package manager.
- #### Fedora and Fedora based distros
- #### Void Linux
- #### OpenSuse
- #### CentOs/RHEL <p>I am not sure about thes distros</p>
</br>

### Run these commands one by one to install zsh and oh-my-zsh
```
git clone https://github.com/me-js-bro/zsh-installation.git
cd zsh-installation
chmod +x install-zsh.sh
./install-zsh.sh
```
